              <h1>Mentoring Groups </h1>
              <p>
                We are excited to be starting a brand new group mentoring initiative and we're looking for candidates to join our spring session. At Girl Dev, we greatly value the importance of mentoring, continuous learning and building upon one's skill set. We also recognize the power of learning in small groups. Small groups enable its members to better understand the work through peer-assisted learning. We all know when you help someone else with a problem you often discover something new yourself, and that's the whole idea! The group mentor-ship model enhances your learning experience and teaches you to learn collaboratively, explain your findings and motivate one another to go further.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are seven mentors who are excited to share our knowledge with those who are willing to learn! The groups will have a maximum size of four and the mentor-ship will span over three months. There will be a final deliverable which will be the result of the collaboration between all the different groups. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The topics that we will be mentoring are the following:
