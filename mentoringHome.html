          	<h1>Mentoring Groups </h1>
            <p>
              We are excited to be starting a new mentoring groups initiative here at Girl Dev. We realize how important mentoring, continuously learning and building on a skill set is. We also love learning in small groups because it has many advantages. Most importantly, it helps you understand things better because you might find yourself teaching someone else. And we all know, by teaching you discover things you didn't know before and it enhances your learning experience. You also learn to collaborate, explain your findings and motivate one another to go further.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are seven mentors who are excited to share our knowledge with those who are willing to learn! The groups will have a maximum size of four and the mentor-ship will span over three months. There will be a final deliverable which will be the result of the collaboration between all the different groups. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The topics that we will be mentoring are the following:
              <ul>
